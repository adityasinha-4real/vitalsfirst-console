# vitalsfirst-console
VitalsFirst is a console-based Python project that simulates an AI-powered patient triage and scheduling system for hospitals.  It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on synthetic medical data to predict patient triage levels — Stable, Urgent, or Critical — based on vital signs and symptom severity.
